## HTML
The website consists of three HTML pages with a navigation design so that each page can link to each other page.

## Sources
The code on each page was constructed by the Codeinstitute as part of their Full Stack Software Development Diploma: more detials are available at: https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/
